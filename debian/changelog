gh (2.4.0+dfsg1-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Revert "Add diversion for /usr/bin/gh to allow concurrent install
    with gitsome", and restore the versioned Conflicts with gitsome.
    Thanks to Antoine Beaupré for talking some sense into me especially
    this case is not like moreutils and parallel. (Closes: #1011545)

gh (2.4.0+dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Limit "Conflicts: gitsome" to older (<< 0.8.0+ds-7.1) versions.
    Thanks to Antoine Beaupre for the suggestion, and for resolving the
    file conflict with gitsome (#1005858) so amicably! (Closes: #1011545)
  * Change default editor from nano to /usr/bin/editor as per Debian Policy
    §11.4. Thanks to Jakub Wilk for the bug report. (Closes: #1008761)
  * Rename "Build-Using" field to "Static-Build-Using" in debian/control
  * Add diversion for /usr/bin/gh to allow concurrent install with gitsome
    and remove Conflicts with gitsome. This is inspired by the conflict
    resolution between the moreutils and parallel packages where both
    contain /usr/bin/parallel.  See discussions in #749355.
