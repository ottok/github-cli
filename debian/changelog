gh (2.4.0+dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Limit "Conflicts: gitsome" to older (<< 0.8.0+ds-7.1) versions.
    Thanks to Antoine Beaupre for the suggestion, and for resolving the
    file conflict with gitsome (#1005858) so amicably! (Closes: #1011545)
  * Change default editor from nano to /usr/bin/editor as per Debian Policy
    ยง11.4. Thanks to Jakub Wilk for the bug report. (Closes: #1008761)
  * Rename "Build-Using" field to "Static-Build-Using" in debian/control
  * Add diversion for /usr/bin/gh to allow concurrent install with gitsome
    and remove Conflicts with gitsome. This is inspired by the conflict
    resolution between the moreutils and parallel packages where both
    contain /usr/bin/parallel.  See discussions in #749355.
